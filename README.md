**MERN Stack Project: Learning and Practice**

## Project Overview:
Welcome to my MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack project! This project serves as a playground for me to dive deep into the world of full-stack web development. By working with the MERN stack, I aim to gain practical experience in building robust and scalable web applications.

## Project Structure:
- **Client**: This directory houses the front-end codebase built using React.js. Here, I handle the user interface, state management, and client-side routing.
- **Server**: In this directory, you'll find the back-end codebase implemented with Node.js and Express.js. It deals with server logic, database operations, and API routes.
- **Database**: MongoDB serves as the database for this project. It stores application data and interacts with the Node.js server through MongoDB's native driver or Mongoose ORM.

## Technologies Used:
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing application data.
- **Express.js**: A minimalist web framework for Node.js used to build the back-end server.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment used for running server-side code.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing a straightforward schema-based solution to model application data.
- **React Router**: A library for handling routing in React applications.

## Project Goals:
1. **Learning Full-Stack Development**: Through this project, I aim to understand the intricacies of both front-end and back-end development.
2. **Building Real-World Applications**: I strive to implement features and functionalities that mimic real-world scenarios, providing me with valuable experience.
3. **Practicing Best Practices**: I intend to follow industry best practices for code organization, documentation, and optimization to enhance the project's quality.
4. **Experimenting with New Technologies**: Throughout the development process, I'll explore various libraries, tools, and techniques to expand my skill set.

## How to Run the Project:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/Adrijchakraborty/mern.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies for both the client and server:
   - For the client: `cd client && npm install`
   - For the server: `cd ../server && npm install`
4. Ensure MongoDB is installed and running on your machine.
5. Start the server: `npm start` inside the `server` directory.
6. Start the client: `npm run dev` inside the `client` directory.
7. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:5173`.
